# Mysidia-Deluxe
Mysidia Deluxe is an open-source custom version of the [Mysidia Adoptables](http://mysidiaadoptables.com/) framework, based off of v1.3.4 and maintained by the community.
## Features
This version overhauls and adds many things, including:
- [x] Bugfixes (like the "rn" issue, and reading other user's PMs)
- [ ] Smoother installation
- [ ] AJAX support
- [x] Reskinned ACP for a more modern look
- [x] 4 brand new themes (2 using Bootstrap 4 and 2 using CSS grids)
- [ ] Overhauled trade system
- [ ] Auction and Raffle system
- [ ] User shops
- [ ] Built-in forum (a forum right on the site, not SMF or myBB)
- [ ] Layered pet image support
- [ ] Bank system
- [ ] Cronjobs
- [x] More HTML (no formbuilders or tablebuilders, html will be used instead)
- And more to come!

## Requirements
- PHP 5.3.0+ (5.4 is recommended)
  - *Will not work on PHP 7*
- PDO support
- (optional) Imagick support. Layered pet images won't work without it.
- (optional) A little PHP knowledge is advised if you wish to expand and add your own features (like custom pages).

## Download information
If you already built a site using Mysidia v1.3.4 or below and plan to use this version, it is recommended to backup your old site and use Mysidia Deluxe as a fresh install rather than for feature splicing unless (you have the knowledge to do so), as this may have unexpected results. That being said, all features in this version are compatible with sites running v1.3.4 if you just wish to borrow them.

If you're planning to use Mysidia Deluxe for a new site, please use the latest version from the releases section. Releases are finalized and you are less likely to run bugs caused by newly added features.

The [original ToS](http://www.mysidiaadoptables.com/tos.php) still applies here, and you may use this script for a commercial site. **You are not allowed to sell the script itself.**
