# Mysidia-Deluxe
Mysidia Deluxe is an open-source custom version of the [Mysidia Adoptables](http://mysidiaadoptables.com/) framework, based off of v1.3.4 and maintained by the community. This version overhauls and adds many things, including:
- Bugfixes (like the "rn" issue, and reading other user's PMs)
- Smoother installation
- Reskinned ACP for a more modern look
- 4 brand new themes (2 using Bootstrap 4 and 2 using CSS grids)
- Overhauled trade system
- Auction and Raffle system
- User shops
- Built-in forum (a forum right on the site, not SMF or myBB)
- Layered pet image support
- Bank system
- Cronjobs
- More HTML (no formbuilders or tablebuilders, html will be used instead)
- And more to come!

While not required, a little PHP knowledge is advised if you wish to expand and add your own features.

If you already built a site using Mysidia v1.3.4 or below and plan to use this version, it is recommended to backup your old site and use Mysidia Deluxe as a fresh install rather than for feature splicing unless (you have the knowledge to do so), as this may have unexpected results.

The [original ToS](http://www.mysidiaadoptables.com/tos.php) still applies here, and you may use this script for a commercial site. **You are not allowed to sell the script itself.**
